## Project-1 Machine Learning based Clustering and PCA Problem
Course: Unsupervised Learning

*Based on given data of visitors browsing for online shopping, build different clusters to know whether person is only browsing and visiting multiples pages or also generating revenue for the shopping websites as well. Analyse and compare the clusters formed with the existing Revenue Column.

*Skills & Tools Covered
-Machine Learning
-Unsupervised Learning
-K-means clustering
-Hierarchical Clustering
-Principal Component Analysis

## Project-2 Machine Learning based Disease Prediction Model
Course: Supervised Learning - Classification

*Build the binomial machine learning model to predict the Parkinson disease. The objective of this model is to classify the patients with the Parkinson disease. Perform the required pre-processing steps prior to model building and evaluate the model performance through proper tuning process.

*Skills & Tools Covered
-Machine Learning
-Supervised Learning
-Linear and Non Linear Classification model
-Hyper parameter
-Model Metrics

## Project-3 Machine Learning model building for continuous variable prediction
Course: Supervised Learning - Regression

*Build a Linear Machine Learning model to understand the relationship between the population of US cities in the year 1920 and 1930. Evaluate the model performance with appropriate measures. Perform all the required graphical and quantitative exploratory data analysis prior to model building. The dataset has 49 rows and 2 columns. The measurements are the population (in 1000's) of 49 U.S. cities in 1920 and 1930. The 49 cities are a random sample taken from the 196 largest cities in U.S

## Project-4 Descriptive Statistics on real world problem
Course: Statistics for Machine Learning

*The first problem statement focuses on exploratory data analysis on a la liga cup (a football tournament). Learners need to analyze the data to get useful insights on top teams, winning distribution etc. The second problem statement helps in understanding and applying confidence intervals to a healthcare related problem. The third problem statement will make learners apply statistical techniques like design experiment and hypothesis testing on designing golf data.

*Skills & Tools Covered
-Descriptive and inferential statistics
-Hypothesis testing
-confidence interval
-Distribution.

## Project-5 Sports Analytics
Course: Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

*A new football club named ‘Brussels United FC’ has just been inaugurated & the team is looking to hire players for their roster. Management wants to make such decisions using data based approach. Player data for all teams has been acquired from FIFA. The data contains details for over 18,000 players playing in various football clubs in Europe. It contains information on age, skill rating, wages and player value, etc. in the files named fifa.csv which is data file and fifa_variable_information.cs
